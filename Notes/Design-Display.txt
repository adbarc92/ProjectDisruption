What is shared by both Traversal and Combat?

Stats: traversal triggers

Display and game are technically distinct, but must be united by a "manager"

The display is the sum of parts that reaches the player: input, visuals, 

Display listens for inputs, which are routed to the controller/manager

If using vertical menus, use an Input stack to determine which menus receive the inputs

1. Display: Load assets, specify spritesheets, specify animations, load sounds

2. After loading, provide screen--start with a window (for development), functions: draw (sprite, animation), play assets

Animation templates (default, attacking, running, etc.)

Actor (something with an animation or a sprite) => Character inherits (more detailed/numerous sprites)

Every actor has a spritebase, which corresponds to a sprite which has been loaded (part of its constructor); also has animation state ("idle", "walking", "attacking", "rummaging", "surprised", "taking damage")

Actor (setAnimation): takes a state as a string, combines it with its spritebase, e.g. "Sophia_attacking"; if animation is found, the Actor sets it as state; otherwise, print to console and set default

Actor has position (X,Y), spritebase (string), animationState (string);
    Functions: draw, update, setPosition

Structure: Game (loop), Display (loads everything, input, drawing), Actor(drawable)

Sprite Object has source image name, offset, dimensions
